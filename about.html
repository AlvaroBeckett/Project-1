                <p>Julia Shreckhise came from a background in science but always had an interest in technology. Working in a lab, she found herself wanting to know more about the software-side processes behind what she was doing and coming up with the ideas to improve them but was lacking the skills to do it herself. After a lot of debate, she decided she needed to switch careers and now she is on track to be a full stack developer com July 2018. </p>
